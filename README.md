I changed the outdated versions of the older source code to work for Swift 3.2 as I was looking for a tutorial and found it very helpful and wanted to share it.  Changed up the depreciated methods to PHPhoto and cleaned up the syntax. I will remove the repo if requested by www.raywenderlich.com, just was here to share and I do not take credit for this code

Just remember to relink the IBAction outlets if the buttons dont work
